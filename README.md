# Engineering Calculators
## Blazor WebAssembly (PWA) app

This SPA will contain a collection of various engineering calculators that
will be added as I need them.

The application will be able save any of the calculations to the clients local system and can be retrieve as needed.

File System API and File System Access API will be used to save the calculations.

This will limit the client to using EDGE or Chrome browsers only. Firefox, Safari, Android os and Apple mobile os are not yet supported
